# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-with-SQL
 As a data analyst intern at Mentorness, I have had the opportunity to dive into a hotel reservation dataset to uncover valuable insights that can help enhance guest experiences and improve hotel operations. 
During this project, I utilized SQL to query and analyze a comprehensive hotel reservation dataset. My goal was to extract meaningful insights and answer specific questions related to guest behavior and booking patterns. The insights gained from this analysis will help inform strategic decisions, ultimately leading to a more efficient and guest-friendly operation.
Throughout this presentation, I will share the key findings from my analysis, highlighting important trends and patterns in the data. These insights will provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing hotel reservations and guestÂ satisfaction.
